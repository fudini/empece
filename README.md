# Akai MPC sequence and song orderer

It's cumbersome to do it in the Akai's software so..  
This app lets you change order of your sequences and rename them.  

# Files
"All Sequences & Songs.xal" - XML file that contains Sequences / Songs and their names and order.  
"*.sxq" - custom format based on MIDI, one per sequence so needs to be renamed. It also contains the name of the sequence that needs to be updated.

# How to build
Follow the guide at [Tauri Guide](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/)

# Obviously
Use at own risk and do a full backup of the project before using it.
